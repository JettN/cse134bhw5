I have added a non-white background color to all pages on the site and changed the text color slightly to complement the background color as having a white background was slightly jarring to my eyes. Additionally, I have replaced my main page with the **About Me** page as it was diorienting that the first page was the **resume**. 

I added `Display: Grid` to the **About Me** page so it is easier to view all of its content when viewing from desktop. Previously, I had everything as one column, which left a lot of unused white space when viewing from desktop. I have also changed the background color of the light/dark mode toggle to make it stand out on the page. 

I removed image rotation when hovered feature. It was giving me a headache constantly seeing the image rotate whenever I accidentally hovered over it.

Added `<hr>` tag at the end of every `<header>` for consistency

Moved all style tags and JS code into files seperate from the html files for personal preference (HTML pages were becoming cluttered)
