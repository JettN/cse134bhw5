I have added a non-white background color to all pages on the site and changed the text color slightly to complement the background color as having a white background was slightly jarring to my eyes. Additionally, I have replaced my main page with the About Me page as it was diorienting that the first page was the resume.I have also changed the background color of the light/dark mode toggle to make it stand out on the page.
